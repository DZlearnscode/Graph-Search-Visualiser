# Graph-Search-Visualiser
GUI for visualising how DSF, BSF and A* algorithm traverse through a maze (grid/graph)



This respiratory contains a GUI programe to visualise the common graph search algorithms; DSF, BSF and A*. Using the pygame library for the graphic user interface.

The code will create a pygame window and draw a grid on it with an options menu

User can build his own maze by building and removing walls, or auto generate a maze

User can attempt solving the maze

BSF

DFS

A star

The GUI can visualise the steps the algorithm takes to solve the maze, however it might significantly impact the performance of DSF and BFS
